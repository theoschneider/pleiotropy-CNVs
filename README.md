# Pleiotropic mechanisms of copy number variants

This script uses both Mendelian randomization and CNV-GWAS files to determine the effects :
- of the CNV on the different traits,
- of the traits on every other trait.  
  
This script is still a work in progress, as well as this README.

## Usage

This program requires the installation of a few packages, which are all listed in the script.  
It also requires a list of IDs as an input, as well as summary stats for the traits of interest.  
The output is a dataframe with rows being very pair of traits, and columns being the different effects, standard errors and p-values.
